# Emotional Dysregulation and Adolescent Violent Crime Psychology: EEG Emotion Analysis & Digital Interventions

## Overview

This repository contains the research and implementation of a comprehensive approach to understanding and mitigating adolescent violent crime through the integration of psychological insights, environmental factors, and advanced digital public health tools. The primary focus of this project is to explore emotional dysregulation and its connection to violent behavior in adolescents, using cutting-edge techniques like EEG-based emotion analysis.

### Key Contributions:
- **Psycho-Social Risk Interaction Model (PRIM):** A framework for understanding the interplay of psychological vulnerabilities (e.g., impulsivity, aggression), environmental stressors (e.g., socioeconomic pressures), and relational influences (e.g., peer and family dynamics).
- **Targeted Intervention and Risk Reduction Strategy (TIRRS):** A system designed to deliver personalized, adaptive interventions based on real-time monitoring of individual psychological and environmental factors.
- **EEG-based Emotion Analysis:** Using electroencephalography (EEG) to analyze emotional responses and predict violent tendencies in adolescents.

## Research Goals

This project aims to address the following key questions:
1. How can EEG emotion analysis be utilized to understand emotional dysregulation in adolescents?
2. How do psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors interact to influence violent behavior in adolescents?
3. How can real-time digital interventions be designed to reduce the risk of violent crime among adolescents?

## Key Features

- **EEG Emotion Analysis**: Real-time collection and analysis of EEG data to assess emotional states linked to aggression.
- **Psycho-Social Risk Interaction Model (PRIM)**: A comprehensive model integrating psychological, environmental, and relational factors to predict adolescent aggression.
- **Personalized Intervention**: The development of personalized intervention strategies based on individual data, aiming to reduce violent tendencies.
- **Digital Public Health Tools**: The integration of technology to create scalable and cost-effective strategies for preventing adolescent violent crime.
